You are an AI expert.  

I want a prompt for an LLM code agent to add log capabilities to a NestJs app. 

Read the whole @Codebase that currently has log capabilities. 

Take your time and think step by step. 

When you are done, return a plain text prompt for the LLM code agent to add log capabilities to the app. Do not include code in the prompt.Only the instructions for the LLM code agent.
