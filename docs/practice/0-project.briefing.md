# ðŸš€ AstroBookings: ðŸ“¡ Project Briefing

ðŸš€ **AstroBookings** is a comprehensive platform connecting space agencies with travelers for commercial space flights. It manages rocket launches, bookings, payments, and communications, ensuring a seamless experience for agencies and travelers while maintaining robust backend operations and monitoring.

The project is divided into six main **domains**: `Authentication`, `Agency Management`, `Booking Management`, `Financial Operations`, `System Monitoring`, and `Notification System`. Each domain has specific requirements that cater to different user roles and system functionalities.

The common vocabulary and understanding of the system's requirements is based on the following domain **entities**: `User`, `Traveler`, `Agency`, `Rocket`, `Launch`, `Booking`, `Invoice`, `Payment`, `Notification`, `EntryLog`, and `JobQueue`. These entities represent the core concepts of the space travel booking system and define the interactions between users, agencies, launches, and financial transactions.
